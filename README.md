# LLM-Detect-Ai-generated-text

Objective :
* The project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately detect whether a text is written by a human or an LLM.

Dataset : 
* Data was taken from kaggle. [ https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data?select=train_prompts.csv ]

Model used : BERT
* BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from a Transformer) is an open-source machine learning framework for natural language processing (NLP). BERT is based on Transformers, a deep learning model in which every output element is connected to every input element, and the weightings between them are dynamically calculated based upon their connection. To read more about this model you can read the following :

Final Result :
* Accuracy 99.8800
